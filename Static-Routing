What is static route ?

- Connecting local network to destination network manually.
- Basically declare the network address of the destination you want send the packet.
- It is not like dynamic routing that automatically detect the best route (neighbour) to communicate



How to configure ?

Next Hop technique:
- ip route <destination network> <netmask> <next hop>  //next hop is the ip address of the incoming interface of the previous router before the destination router

Exit interface technique:
- ip route <destination network> <netmask> <exit interface>  //the outbound interface of the router before your destination 

Default route:
- ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 <next hop>  //0.0.0.0 means all destination address which covers ip address from 0.0.0.0 - 255.255.255.255 .
